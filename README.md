# Module_13_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

As a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup I have used machine learning and neural networks, to decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

## Purpose
* The purpose of the analysis is to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful.

## Process
Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.

## Technologies

Python, Pandas Library, Anaconda Jupyter Lab, Pathlib Library, tensorflow, sklearn.
